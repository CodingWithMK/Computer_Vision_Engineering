# Computer Vision Engineering Series

Welcome to the **Computer Vision Engineering** learning series — a comprehensive, hands-on, 12-week roadmap to becoming a proficient Computer Vision Engineer.

This repository contains all the weekly learning modules, mini-projects, quizzes, and implementation notebooks organized in a micro-learning format (20–30 minutes per day). Each week is focused on a core topic in computer vision, progressing from foundational concepts to real-world deployment.
